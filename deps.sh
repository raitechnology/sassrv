# deps.sh — clone (and optionally build) this repo's sibling dependencies.
#
# The dependency list comes from build_depends.mak (the same file the srpm
# target substitutes into rpm BuildRequires), so there is exactly one place
# that names the deps.  Repos are cloned as SIBLINGS of this checkout
# (../raikv, ../raimd, ...), which is the layout the GNUmakefile's
# -I../<dep>/include and ../<dep>/FC43_*/lib64 link paths expect.
#
#   ./deps.sh          clone missing siblings
#   ./deps.sh -b       clone missing siblings, then build all in dep order
#   ./deps.sh -n       dry run (show what would happen)
#
# Versions in build_depends.mak are rpm BuildRequires minimums; master of
# each dep normally satisfies them.  To pin exactly, check out matching
# tags in the sibling checkouts after cloning.
#
# Prefer packages?  The whole chain publishes on COPR:
#   dnf copr enable injinj/rel && dnf install rvcache
